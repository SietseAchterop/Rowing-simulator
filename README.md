# Rowing software

Here my attemps at creating a rowing simulator.
The first, failed, attempt was done using gazebo with ROS.

The next attemps use OpenSim. Pusher contains the simplest version of a "leg" pushing
a boat through the water. Well, actually the boat is a box on the ground an friction is used
to simulate the water.
